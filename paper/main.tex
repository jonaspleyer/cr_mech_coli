\begin{abstract}
    \aclp{abm} have become popular tools in the study of complex cellular systems.
    However, despite their popularity, it is often difficult to systematically estimate their
    parameters and perform advanced analyses, e.g., using the profile-likelihood.
    In this work, we study the mechanical properties of rod-shaped bacteria and provide techniques
    for estimating their parameters and performing identifiability analysis on them.
    Our approach may serve as a blueprint for a modular framework which can be adapted to other
    research questions.
    We use time series of microscopic images as input data and incorporate advanced effects as the
    elasticity of the rod.
    The developed model serves as a generalized foundation to describe multiple species of
    rod-shaped bacteria such as \textit{E.Coli} or \textit{B.Subtilis}.

\acp{abm} have proven to be powerfull tools in the study of complex cellular
systems~\cite{Pleyer2023}.
They have been applied in various scenarios, such as cancer
research~\cite{Ghaffarizadeh2018,Cooper2020}, Immuno-Oncology~\cite{Karolak2021} or the modeling
of mechanical intercellular connections in plant cells \textbf{TODO CITATION}.
By treating cells as individual entities, these tools allow researchers to think in terms of
cellular properties and processes thus allowing for a better understanding of the biological
reality.

Despite their popularity, \acp{abm} face multiple challenges in practise.
The construction of a fully functional \ac{abm} simulation from the ground up constitutes an
intricate and laborious process, necessitating a comprehensive array of skills. It is therefore
common practise to reuse existing simulation tools, which, in turn, brings along a number of
other problems.
Even if the existing tool is designed to be generalizable, it often comes with a pre-defined set
of parameters that need to be specified.
Furthermore, as we have discussed in our previous work~\cite{Pleyer2023}, these tools were most
often not designed to be flexible but rather built for specific purposes thus limiting their
generalizability \textbf{TODO CITATION}.
Typically researchers estimate the parameter of their model using methods such as Maximum Likelihood
or Maximum a Posteriori~\cite{Gbor2015,Banga2008,Ashyraliyev2009}, check for parameter
identifiability using methods like profile-likelihood or apply model reduction
techniques~\cite{Kreutz2013,Raue2014,Simpson2025}.

In the context of \acp{abm}, however, it is often only shown that the generated results lead to the
desired phenomenon aligning with the observed biological reality.
But this process does not actually estimate the necessary parameters directly \textbf{TODO CITATION}.
Consequently, it reduces the confidence in the constructed models and raises concerns with respect
to the validity of the obtained results.
In this work, we address these challenges using a general-purpose mechanical model for rod-shaped
bacteria as an example.
Our approach provides various methods which can be combined to systematically estimate the
parameters of our model. We deliberately distinguish between conceptually separate components within
this framework.
This modularity highlights a "blueprint" which can be adapted and applied to other \acp{abm}.

Mechanical properties of rod-shaped bacteria have been studied in great detail
experimentally~\cite{Chatterjee1988,Takeuchi2005,IWAI2002}.
It was found that the MreB protein is the driving force in maintaining their distinct elongated
shape~\cite{Ursell2014}, which plays an important role in the dynamics of
growth~\cite{Billaudeau2017}, division~\cite{Harry2001} and their collective
behaviour~\cite{vanGestel2015,Balagam2015}.
Furthermore, it has been discovered that the rod can be bent thus introducing temporary elastic or
permanent plastic deformations~\cite{Amir2014_2}.
Rod-shaped Bacteria are an interesting target system since their physical form provides more surface
information compared to other forms such as spherical cells.
In addition, parameters such as growth rates have been found to vary across multiple
cells~\cite{Koutsoumanis2013} which highlights the need to incorporate this heterogeneity on a
single-cell level.

Computational models for rod-shaped bacteria allow researchers to systematically analyze their
properties and infer emergent phenomena~\cite{Cho2007,Jnsson2005}.
Existing tools can describe growth, division and many effects such as colony formation and
expansion~\cite{Matyjaszkiewicz2017,Doumic2020} but they are limited in describing the
aforementioned plastic or elastic deformations of the rod. Furthermore, the literature on how to
estimate the parameters of such models directly from data is very sparse.

\textbf{
    Was mir hier nicht gefällt, ist, dass du von Parameter schätzen bei ABMs kommend ziemlich
    detailliert über Mechanik redest.
    Das passt nicht.
    Man erwartet mehr Infos über den Blueprint und ist verwirrt.
    Worum geht es hier?
}

This work addresses some of these limitations.
We use microscopic image time series as inputs to obtain information about the spatial configuration
of the cells.
This information can be used as initial values for a numerical simulation.
By varying the parameters of the model and comparing the results to the microscopic data, we can
estimate and quantify the parameters of our model.
Our approach takes a general stance which incorporates effects that are observed within
\textit{B.Subtilis} and \textit{E.Coli}.

\section{Overview}
This work consists of many subcomponents which can be combined in order to achieve various tasks.
Figure~\ref{fig:flowchart-project-structure} shows a high-level overview of all components.
We assume that bacterial rods can be represented by a colleciton of vertices (see
section~\ref{subsec:spatial-representation}).
This assumption alone is enough to enable a cascade of other components.
Using the spatial representation, we provide visualization methods that create 3D models from the
given vertices which can then either be rendered or projected to a 2D plane.
The data extraction component determines the vertices from given cell masks which
correspond to microscopic images.
This allows us in particular to turn any sequence of images (movie) into a sequence of bacterial
positions.
The dynamics of the vertices are determined by a computational model which is specific
to the respective use-case and should be defined by the researcher.
It merely needs to utilize the aforementioned spatial representation of bacterial rods as a
collection of vertices.
This work will provide one example of how such a model can be defined.
Notably, the visualization and data extraction components do not require any knowledge about the
computational model, thus allowing us to reuse their functionality across multiple models.

Constructing a computational model requires knowledge about the target system and thus allows us to
interpret the results gathered by the provided data extraction methods.
These results can then further be used to restrict or determine the parameters of our model.
For example, by extracing the positions of bacteria across a time-series of microscopic images, we
can also calculate their lengths at these time-points and thus determine their rate of growth and
type of growth (see section~\ref{subsec:parameter-estimation-individual-treatment}), thus
effectively guiding our modeling steps.

Visualization methods are an integral part of any modeling endevaour.
They allow researchers to obtain feedback quickly and improve iteration times when constructing new
models. Furthermore, we utilize them in our more advanced parameter estimation methods (see
section~\ref{section:parameter-estimation}) where they enable us to effectively compare
two bacterial configurations across division events.
In the future, we are planning to build on the current state and generate realistic microscopic
images and time-series.
Together with the parameter estimation methods, they can then be used to provide large amounts of
mechanistic data for the training of cell-segmentation and cell-tracking machine-learning
algorithms.

\section{A Computational Model for Rod-Shaped Bacteria}
\label{sec:computational-model}

@Christian
\begin{itemize}
    \item shortened everything
    \item leave out parts which are not directly used by the model
    \item move biological context to respective subsections to link more directly to model
    \item remove duplicates and useless text
    \item move heterogeneity considerations from table in main text
\end{itemize}

The mechanical behaviour of rod-shaped bacteria is governed by a plethora of effects.
In this work, we aim to establish a model which is general enough such that it can be reused as the
basis for many variants of rod-shaped bacteria but also explicit enough such that we can quantify
its parameters.
We thus utilize only a minimal set of assumptions.
When describing the bacterial system, we distinguish between intra-cellular processes and cell-cell
interactions.
We restrict ourselves to the features discussed below and summarize them in
Table~\ref{table:simulation-aspects}.
% For a collection of other known aspects which could be considered, we refer to the supplementary
% section~\ref{section:discussion}, and~\ref{section:supplement-more-simulation-aspects}.

While some rod-shaped bacteria grow by inserting new material at the ends, \textit{E.Coli} and
\textit{B.Subtilis} utilize a method where new material is inserted along the cylindrical part of
the rod. The details of the division event (i.e. Z-Ring formation) are very intricate and are heavily
studied as a subject on their own~\cite{Harry2001}.
On a higher level view, the rod is split apart at a point close to the center of the cell, thus
creating two new daughter cells.
It was shown that the best predictor for when the division event occurs, is the length of the rod as
opposed to the age of bacterium~\cite{Robert2014}.
Furthermore, not only the growth of the whole colony but also the growth of individual bacteria is
exponential~\cite{Amir2014,Takeuchi2005}.
The growth rates of individual bacteria and other process parameters can be heterogeneous which
should be accounted for as well \cite{Koutsoumanis2013}.

Many bacteria organize into biofilms~\cite{Dunne2002,Ong1999} which play a key role in the survival
of the collective.
Their formation is only possible due to the attractive nature of bacterial interactions between
each other~\cite{Berne2018}.
This interaction is characterized by a long-range attraction and short-ranged
adherance~\cite{Verwey1947,Trejo2013}.
We therefore need account for this phenomenon as well.

        possible.
        These are the assumptions for the basic model that we are presenting here.
        In order for our methods to work, we are really only required to satisfy the assumption of
        our spatial representation (see section~\ref{subsec:spatial-representation}) and thus, these
        assumptions can also be loosened if required.

\subsection{Spatial Representation}
\label{subsec:spatial-representation}
This work makes use of a one powerful assumption concerning the mathematical representation of the
cells.
To model the spatial mechanics of elongated bacteria \cite{Billaudeau2017}, we represent them as a
collection of auxiliary vertices $\{\vec{x}_i\}$.
We treat this collection of vertices as a discretization of the rod where the individual segments
between the vertices carry no explicit physical or biological meaning.
This assumption alone is enough to be able to build visualization and data-extraction pipelines (see
\ref{fig:flowchart-project-structure}).
Our computational model builds on top of this assumption and utilizes this representation to
define the dynamics of the vertices $\{\vec{x}_i\}$.
For this study, we will choose a particular type of model incorporating a chosen set effects.
But researchers are in general free to adapt the model for the specific problem at hand.
By building on our discretization scheme, future modeling approaches will be able to directly reuse
our established theoretical methods and computational functionalities.

\textbf{TODO mention this in sections below}
\begin{itemize}
    \item plastic/elastic deformations
    \item non-uniform thickness of the rod

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item represent bacteria as polygon with vertices $\vec{x}_i$

        equilibrium state of a straight rod with no curvature.
    }
    \label{fig:mechanics-bacterium}
\end{figure}

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Mechanics}
\label{subsection:mechanical-model-mechanics}
In rod-shaped bacteria, the MreB protein plays a key role for the maintenance of the cellular shape.
It forms an actin-like cytoskeleton~\cite{Erickson2001,Dersch2020} and localizes specifically at
regions of negative curvature thus introducing heterogeneous cell growth~\cite{Ursell2014} which
results in a bending force during growth.
This feedback mechanism will result in straight rod-shaped bacteria if not interfered from the
external environment~\cite{Wang2010}.

We use principles from discrete differential geometry~\cite{bobenko2008discrete} to describe the
stiffness of the bacterial rod~\cite{Amir2014_2}.
As explained above, MReB will counteract the bending of the rod, resulting in a stiffening force.
We model the bacterium as a bending beam.
% In principle, this stress will be dependent on the position inside the cell~\cite{Chatterjee1988},
% but for sake of simplicity we chose to model the bacterium as a bending beam.
% \textbf{[", thus utilizing the simplest solution which can still produce the desired effects." Es ist unklar was die "desired effects" sind. ]}\\
Using our discretization $\vec{x}_i$, we connect the vertices by springs of length $l$.
% which can be represented by a collection of vertices $\vec{x}_i$ which are connected by a
% springs of lengths $l$.
% \textbf{[Das klingt nach einer Wiederholung von Spatial Representation. Du erklärst ziemlich umständlich. Konzentriere dich auf das wesentliche und überlege, was du eigentlich sagen möchtest.]}\\
We use the notation $\vec{w}_i:=\vec{x}_i-\vec{x}_{i-1}$ with which the resulting force acting
between two vertices if given by

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{i,\text{springs}} =
        -\gamma\left(1 - \frac{l}{\left|\vec{w}_i\right|}\right) \vec{w}_i
        + \gamma\left(1 - \frac{l}{\left|\vec{w}_{i+1}\right|}\right) \vec{w}_{i+1}.
\end{equation}

The value of the spring constants determines the elasticity with respect to elongation of the cell.
In situations where this aspect is not relevant, they merely serve as a auxiliary parameters to
maintain the length of the rod.
In addition to springs between individual vertices $\vec{x}_i$, we assume that each angle at a
vertex between edges is subject to a force indiced by curvature.
% We assume that we can model the mechanical properties of the bacterium as an elastic rod.
Given the angle $\alpha_i = \sphericalangle(\vec{w}_{i-1},\vec{w}_i)$ between adjacent edges,
the bending force is proportional to the curvature $\kappa_i$ at each vertex
$\kappa_i = 2\tan(\alpha_i/2)$.
The resulting force acts along the angle bisector which can be calculated from the edge vectors.
Figure~\ref{fig:mechanics-bacterium} shows an elongated rod represented by $6$ vertices.
The force acting on vertex $\vec{x}_i$ is given by

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{i,\text{curvature}} = \eta\kappa_i
        \frac{\vec{w}_i - \vec{w}_{i+1}}{|\vec{w}_i-\vec{w}_{i+1}|}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_i$ is the rigidity at vertex $\vec{x}_i$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:mechanics-bacterium}).
The adjoining vertices $\vec{x}_{i-1},\vec{x}_{i+1}$ are subject to half of the same force in the
opposite direction $\vec{F}_{i\pm 1,\text{curvature}} = -0.5\vec{F}_{i,\text{curvature}}$.
We can see that the curvature force does not move the overall center of the rod in space.
The total force is the sum of interal and external forces.

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{i,\text{total}} = \vec{F}_{i,\text{springs}}+ \vec{F}_{i,\text{curvature}}
        + \vec{F}_{i,\text{external}}
\end{equation}

and are integrated via damped newtonian dynamics

\begin{equation}
    \partial_t^2 \vec{x}_i = \vec{F}_{i,\text{total}} - \lambda \partial_t\vec{x}_i
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ a damping constant and the mass was set to $1$ to simplify the model.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Physical Interactions - Mie Potential}

Calculating the force between cells requires performing a double integral over the length of the
cells.
To reduce the computational costs we use an approximative, simplified model.
Given a vertex $\vec{x}_i$ on one cell, we determine the closest point $\vec{p}$ on the polygonal
line given by the vertices $\{\vec{y}_j\}$ of the interacting cell.
Furthermore we determine the value $q\in[0,1]$ such that $\vec{p} = (1-q)\vec{y}_j + q\vec{y}_{j+1}$
for some specific $j$.
The force is then calculated between the points $\vec{x}_i$ and $\vec{p}$ and acts on
the vertex $\vec{y}_j,\vec{y}_{j+1}$ with relative strength $(1-q)$ and $q$.

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{i,\text{External}} = \vec{F}(\vec{x}_i,\vec{p})
\end{equation}

We utilize the Mie potential~\cite{Mie1903} to describe the attraction between two cells.
It is the generalization of the well-known Lennard-Jones~\cite{Jones1924} potential and was designed
to describe the interactions between molecules.
The Mie potential is given by:

\begin{align}
    U(r) &= C\epsilon\left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^n -
        \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^m\right]\\
    C &= \frac{n}{n-m}\left(\frac{n}{m}\right)^{\frac{n}{n-m}}
\end{align}

The strength of the potential is given by $\epsilon$ and the thickness of our rods
is encoded in $\sigma = (m/n)^{1/(n-m)}(R_1+R_2)$ where $R_1,R_2$ are the thicknesses (radii) of the
two interacting rod-like bacteria.
We utilize the shorthand notation $r=|\vec{x}_i - \vec{p}|$ for the distance between the two points
in question.
We numerically regularize the potential by imposing an upper bound $\beta$ on the norm of the
resulting force $\vec{F} = \vec{\nabla} V$.
Furthermore, we impose a cutoff parameter $\zeta$ which sets sets the force to zero when the
distance $r$ between the interacting points exceeds this threshold.
The resulting force is given by

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{i,\text{external}} = \vec{F} \theta(r-\zeta) \min\left(1, \beta / |\vec{F}|\right)
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the heaviside step-function and the $\min$ term ensures the upper bound $\beta$.

The physical interaction between the bacteria plays a crucial role for the overall dynamics of the
system.
By varying its parameters, the Mie potential is capable of describing a wide range of interaction
types from softer ones that permit some level of overlap to rigid ones with steep ascends for
distance valuels that correspond to overlaps.
In contrast, a popular alternative is the Morse potential~\cite{Morse1929}, which is less
customizable due to the lower amount of parameters and more restrictive mathematical formulation.
Therefore, the Mie potential is a good choice for a simple, interpretable interaction potential with
low amount of parameters that can be estimated by our data-driven approach.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cell-Cycle}

To simulate cellular growth, we introduce an exponential growth term for the spring lengths $l$
\cite{Takeuchi2005}.

\begin{equation}
    \partial_t l = \mu l
\end{equation}

This process will increase the length of the cell indefinitely unless we impose a condition for the
division event.
The cell divides when the spring length $l$ has reached a fixed length threshold~\cite{Robert2014}
$l_\text{thresh}$.
To construct a new cell, we cannot simply copy the existing one twice, but we also need to adjust
internal parameters in the process.
The following actions need to be taken for the old and new agent.
We first calculate the new spring lengths of the two resulting rods via

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{l} = l\left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{R}{n_v l}\right)
\end{equation}

where $n_v$ is the number of vertices and $R$ the previously introduced thickness of the rod.
This relation ensures that that the tips of the two new rods are touching right after the division
event.
We subdivide the polygon given by the vertices of the mother cell in $n$ segments of length
$\tilde{l}$, one segment of length $2R$ and again $n$ segments of length $\tilde{l}$.
The first and latter groups determine the new vertices of the two daughter cells.
This approach assumes cells where the total length of the polygon is greater than its diameter
$n_vl>2R$.
We set the growth rates of the daughter cells explicitly during the division event.
This approach allows us to treat the growth rates of the daughter cells as full individual
parameters within our model.
In order to reuse this model, we also provide the option to assign growth rates by sampling from a
normal distribution with user-defined parameters.
Every other intracellular parameter is copied identically to the daughter cells.
Table~\ref{table:list-of-parameters} shows a list of all parameters used within our model.

\subsection{Numerical Implementation}

We implemented the described model in our recently developed \ac{abm} framework
\texttt{cellular\_raza}~\cite{Pleyer2025}.
By design \texttt{cellular\_raza} does not assume any particular cellular representation, thus makes
it flexible and easy to adapt the simulation to particular needs.
Its design allows us to experiment with different model implementations while retaining fast
execution times.
\textbf{[Der Zusammenhang zwischen der Flexibilität und Performance ist unklar.]}
\textit{Oft muss man das eine für das andere opfern. Hier nicht/kaum.}

Furthermore, it is an \ac{abm} which is able to natively track cells through the course of a
numerical simulation and also keeps track of mother/daughter relationships.
\textbf{[Das scheint hier trivial zu sein.]}

\section{Methodology}
These sections introduce methods which can be combined in order to estimate the parameters of our
computational model.
It has to be noted that they only depend on the spatial representation described in
section~\ref{subsec:spatial-representation}.
Consequently, these methods can be applied to a broader class of mechanical models that may exhibit
varied cellular behaviours.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Visualization}
\label{subsection:visualization}
To visualize the spatial configuration of the results we employ pyvista, which provides high-level
wrappers around the popular VTK library~\cite{vtkBook,Sullivan2019}.
The initial phase of the visualization process entails the generation of three-dimensional meshes
for each bacterium as an intermediate representation.
We insert spheres matching the thickness of the rod $R$ at each vertex $\vec{x}_i$ and connect
adjacent vertices $\vec{x}_i,\vec{x}_{i+1}$ with a cylinder, also of radius $r$ which is positioned
such that its core is identical to the connecting line segment between the two vertices.
Finally, we combine the meshes of all of these objects to obtain a single mesh of one bacterium.

A render of this result can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:progression-image-generation}.
Since we use a 3D rendering engine for our visualization, the resulting image can have
overlaps of bacteria which are placed at higher or lower values along the z-direction.
To generate masks, we assign unique colours to every mesh of the respective cellular agent, ensuring
no two agents will use identical colours. \textbf{TODO semantic segmentation Citation}
We then use a parallel projection and remove any existing light sources in order to obtain a solid
color for every cell-agent.
The resulting image is shown in subfigure (B).

\subsection{Position Extraction}

This section will explain how we can determine the collection of vertices $\vec{x}_i$ introduced in
subsection~\ref{subsection:mechanical-model-mechanics} from microscopic images
(Figure~\ref{fig:position-extraction-algorithm} (A)).
The extracted vertices for multiple time points will be used by our parameter estimation methods as
input data.
The algorithms which we devised requires the input of cell-masks which utilize a unique color for
every cell in the image.

Such masks can be generated by cell-segmentation tools or obtained by annottating microscopic images
by hand (Figure~\ref{fig:position-extraction-algorithm} (B)).
Afterwards, we proceed with the following 5 steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Obtain submasks for each cell individually.
    \item Skeletonize submask with algorithm from Lee~\cite{Lee1994}
    \item Determine endpoints $\vec{q}_0,\vec{q}_1$.
        Assert that there are only 2 endpoints.
    \item Sort points such that they form a polygon.
    \item Interpolate vertices $\vec{x}_i$ from obtained polygon.
\end{enumerate}

In the first step, the image will be split into a collection of subimages that only contain
information for one single cell.
From there, we apply a skeletonization algorithm~\cite{Lee1994}
(Figure~\ref{fig:position-extraction-algorithm} (C)).
It has to be noted that there are multiple variants of skeletonization and in general, these classes
of algorithms can produce results which have intersection points and multiple endpoints, which is
undesirable in our case.
We have found that for most practical examples, the algorithm devised by~\cite{Lee1994} works well.\\

The skeletonization algorithm supplies us with a collection of unordered lattice points $\vec{p}_i$
(pixel coordinates) where the skeleton lives.
We identify the endpoints $\vec{q}_0,\vec{q}_1$ by counting the number of neighbors in the von
Neumann neighborhood for each lattice point.
Any point with exactly one neighboring point must be and endpoint.
If we encounter more or less than two points which fit this criterion, the routine can not commence
and is aborted.
Next, we start with one of the endpoints and determine the next neighbor which was not yet picked.
We list the points in this order, thus forming a sorted polygon of pixel coordinates.\\
In the last step, we take the sorted, extracted points $\vec{p}_i$ and interpolate $n$ values for
the desired number of vertices $\vec{x}_i$.

\paragraph{Benchmarking the Extraction Algorithm}

In order to determine if our extraction algorithm provides reliable results, we set out to compare
extracted data with known real data.
Our methodology makes use of the fact that we have already set up our model and solving scheme and
are able to produce cell masks from these numerical results.
In doing so, we have exact knowledge about the position of our agents since we can simply obtain
this information from our computational model.
But on the other hand we can also try to extract these positions from the generated cell-masks.
By comparing the differences between them, we get a good estimate of how well our extraction
algorithm can determine the true position of the bacteria.

In figure~\ref{fig:benchmarking-extraction-algorithm} (A-C) we see snapshots of a time series of
masks.
This particular simulation includes division events between images (B) and (C).
For all images (A-C), we have drawn the exact position of the agents with white lines and indicated
the extracted positions with crosses.
They align very well visually.
It may be hard to spot with the bare eye, but the agreement between extracted and exact positions is
visually worse at the endpoints of the rods.
To quantify this disparity, we calculate the distance between these individual vertices.
Figure~\ref{fig:benchmarking-extraction-algorithm} (D) shows the estimated length of the rods from
the extracted and exact vertices which is surrounded by the average vertex distance.
Division events lead to steps in our rod-length function since the bacterial length is halved.
We can clearly see that the agreement is very good in the beginning but right after every division
event, the uncertainty becomes large.
To illustrate this, we can see that in figure~\ref{fig:benchmarking-extraction-algorithm} (C) some
of the rods are partially overlapping which hides parts of the individual cell-masks and thus
changes the extraction result.
We also plotted the distribution of individual vertex distances in
figure~\ref{fig:benchmarking-extraction-algorithm} (E).
Darker areas in the plot correspond to distances at time-points earlier in the simulatin time.
We can see that brighter areas tend to shift towards the right, thus increasing the uncertainty of
the extraction.
However, the overall distribution shows small values of distances for a large number of vertices and
is not dominated by outliers.

\subsection{Parameter Estimation}
\label{section:parameter-estimation}
In order to effectively estimate the parameters of our model, we need to set up a cost function
which can be minimized.
In doing so, we hope to identify all parameters, given relevant experimental data.
Parameters may be defined as global ones, which are identical across all cells or individual per
cell.
We utilize the preceding algorithms to extract data from cell-masks, simulate from an initial state
and then compare both results.
The cell-masks are easily obtainable by either using existing segmentation
tools~\cite{Cutler2022,Stringer2020,Hardo2022} or manually annotating microscopic image series.

\textbf{Du solltest hier erwähnen, dass du die Parameter per Bakterium fittest und nicht globale Parameter.}
\textit{Tue ich aber nicht grundsätzlich. Es gibt globale und individuelle parameter; also ein "mixed approach". Ich habe aber einen Hinweis eingefügt.}

\paragraph{Direct Comparison}
In the scenario where no cells divide during the observed interval, we can use our extraction
algorithm to obtain the position of the cells and then compare them directly to the positions
calculated from the computational results.
Each cell contains a collection of vertices.
Given $M$ cells with $N$ vertices each and dimension $d$, the total information can be stored in an
array $\nu_{i,j,k}$ of shape $(M,N,2)$.
Comparing the results of a simulation $\nu$ with experimental values $\tilde{\nu}$ is thus only a
matter of comparing two of these arrays within a suitable cost function~\cite{Wang2020}.
In our approach we utilize a least squares approach given by

\begin{equation}
    L_{\text{LS}}(\vec{x}, \vec{y})
        = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i,j,k}|\nu_{i,j,k} - \tilde{\nu}_{i,j,k}|^2}
\end{equation}

which minimizes the distance between the corresponding vertices.
One important detail is that the ordering of vertices must be identical in the numerical and
experimental values.

\paragraph{Comparison across Generations}
The preceding algorithm is performant and effective but can not be applied in the event of a
division process.
Due to possibly differing division times, a cell which is present in the simulation might not yet
have a corresponding cell in the experimental data at this time point yet (or vice-versa).
In order to still be able to compare these datapoints, we require additional methods which can be
used for comparisons across division events.
\textbf{[Es bleibt unklar, was du hier verhandeln möchtest.]}
\textit{Jetzt klarer?}

To this end we use the numerical results of the \ac{abm} simulation and our visualization
algorithms to generate cell-masks (see section~\ref{subsection:visualization}).
Each pixel has a unique color value which is directly related to one particular cell or background
(black).
We compare the generated masks to the experimentally obtained ones pixel by pixel.
Whenever two colors are not matching, a penalty of $1$ is assigned.
The total cost is the sum of all penalties.
% This algorithm is an implementation of a signed area measure.
It is important to take into account the parental relationship between the cells, by checking if
either one of the colors corresponding to the compared colors is a daughter of the other cell.
Figure~\ref{fig:mask-difference-metric} (A,B) shows two successive states of a numerical simulation
with varying amounts of cells.
We can see that some cells have divided while others have only grown without completing a division
step.
The resulting penalties without accounting for the parental relationships are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:mask-difference-metric} (C).
Black indicates that the pixels are matching and no penalty is assigned while a white pixel
indicates that the original pixels are not matching, thus adding to the overall cost.
In contrast, Figure~\ref{fig:mask-difference-metric} (D) takes the parental relationship into
account and highlights regions where compared pixels belong to mother-daughter cells in gray.
We assign a penalty $0\leq p \leq 1$ which is a hyperparameter for this optimization algorithm.
% It is possible to assign a custom value for the parental cost value.
Settings its value to $0$ results in a contiuous cost function in time.

Future extensions should introduce a time-dependent parent penalty $p=p(t)$ which grows with the age
of the daughter cells.
Furthermore, the developed algorithm relies on the comparison of two images and can as such make use
of existing machine-learning workflows that construct cost functions for such
scenarios~\cite{Dice1945}.\\
\textbf{@Christian are these two sentences Discussion?}

Although this optimization scheme was driven by technical challenges, it is also biologically
motivated.
In the infenitisemal time point after the division event the resulting two daughter cells will cover
precisely the space that the mother had taken up.
Often times, the exact time at which the fission event has commenced can not be determined
accurately, thus leading to uncertainties with respect to the question when the life of the daughter
cells begins and the one of the mother ends.

In a different approach, one might be tempted to utilize the previously constructed direct
comparison algorithm for time intervals that do not contain any division events.
But this attempt would quickly lead to multiple problems.
It will not be able to deal with the uncertainties of the timing of the division event.
As the number of investigated cells grows, more division events will occurr even in a fixed
amount of time thus greatly decreasing or completely vanishing the effective interval at which no
division event is observed.
The latter situation is equivalent to two microscopic images as input data between which a division
event has occured.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Testing the Comparison Algorithm with Division Events}
When utilizing a computational model (see section~\ref{sec:computational-model}), we can generate
data and use the generated masks to provide a benchmark of our algorithm.
To do this, we set out to calculate the cost between two successive iteration steps
$t_n$ with $t_{n+1}$.
We expect to obtain an exponential growth in the cost.
This can be explained by the fact that the growth of the total area is exponential in time.
Furthermore, the temporal area difference can be viewed as a derivative of the total area in time,
which is again an exponential function.
Figure~\ref{fig:mask-difference-metric} (E) shows the total cost for this approach.
We can see that by accounting for the parental relationship, we get the overall desired effect.
This method allows us to compare results between states that have a different number of cells.
However, since this algorithm requires us to calculate a cell-mask for each comparison and then also
process this mask as well as the comparator, it is much more computationally demanding.
After all, for each comparison step, we need to run a full 3D visualization pipeline.
In cases where the simpler approach of comparing positions of the agents is possible, this method
should be preferred.

\section{Application 1: Elastic deformations of \textit{E.Coli}}
\label{section:application-1}

We will use our previously developed computational model and apply it directly to the data provided
by the experiments of Amir et. al~\cite{Amir2014,Amir2014_2}.
\textbf{[Es wäre gut zu sagen, was für ein Ziel du verfolgst. Warum machst du das?]}
They studied how a single \textit{E.Coli}, which is fixed at the bottom, reacts to a horizontal
fluid flow that exerts a force onto the bacteria.
This setup is displayed in figure~\ref{fig:amir-bending-simulation} (A).
To model this configuration, the lowermost vertex of the rod is fixed at the base of the simulation
domain.

Furthermore, we introduce a force $\vec{F}_i = C |\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_{i+1}|\sin(\alpha_i)\vec{e}_x$
that acts similarly to Stoke's Law \textbf{TODO Citation} onto the normal component of each
rod-segment where $\alpha_i$ is the angle of the rod edge between $\vec{x}_i$ and $\vec{x}_{i+1}$
and the x-axis.
We extract the position of the rod from the provided image and use it as initial value.
Our simulation is split into two phases, one with an external force that initially bends the rod,
and a second one during which the force is disabled and the cell returns to its original shape.
We compare the simulated positions with the extracted ones and calculate the euclidean distance
between them, which we use as the cost function to estimate the parameters of this model.

Since this model is void of any interactions or cell division, we are left with 5 parameters:
Magnitude of the drag force $C$, growth rate $\alpha$, rigidity of the rod $\eta$, spring tension
$\gamma$ and damping constant $\lambda$.
Figure~\ref{fig:amir-bending-simulation} (B) shows a snapshot of the initial (orange) and final
(blue) position of the rod using the optimized parameters.
While the parameters for the dragging force, growth rate and damping can be identified, the same
can not be said for the rod rigidity and spring tension, which both are not identifiable.
However this behaviour is expected since, the shape of the rod is almost exclusively straight, thus
adding no further information except that a lower threshold of rigidity and spring tension should be
present.
\textbf{[Ist mir nicht ganz klar]}

Note that each point represented in the subfigures~\ref{fig:amir-bending-simulation} (C-G) was
optimized again, meaning that higher values of rigidity and spring tension can also lead to higher
values of drag forces.
\textbf{[Ist mir nicht ganz klar.]}

Furthermore the used images only contain snapshots of a fully-bent or fully-relaxed rod without any
intermediate steps.
This effectively limits us to 2 datapoints and is likely the key factor that leads to the two local
minima observed in the damping profile.
This is further supported by the observation that the contributions to the cost function is evenly
distributed between the bent and relaxed position of our system.

To remove this non-identifiability we reduce the number of parameters by setting $\gamma=\gamma_0/s$
and $\eta=\eta_0 s$ for the rod rigidity and spring tension, resp.
We then optimize for this parameter and pick $\gamma_0=\SI{15}{\micro\metre}$ with
$\eta_0=\SI{150}{\micro\metre\per\second\squared}$ which corresponds to $60\%$ of the previously considered
interval.
The corresponding plots can be seen in \ref{subsec:supplement-parameter-profiles-amir}.

\section{Application 2: \textit{E.Coli.} growing on Agar}
\label{section:application-2}
To show the usefulness of our previously developed methods
(see section~\ref{section:parameter-estimation}), we will use them to estimate the parameters
individual growing \textit{E.Coli} using a sequence of microscopic images.
The data we use~\cite{https://doi.org/10.3203/iwf/k-129} (see
section~\ref{section:data-code-availability}) has been automatically segmented with the
omnipose~\cite{Cutler2022} algorithm by mean of which the necessary cell masks are obtained.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Individual Treatment}

We have already suspected (see table~\ref{table:simulation-aspects}) that in order to properly
estimate parameters of our system, we need to treat every cell individually, thus assigning
parameters on a single-cell level.
This means that we increase the total number of parameters that need to be sampled within an
optimization routine.
Given $N_c$ cells and $N_p$ parameters per cell and $N_u$ individual parameters (where $N_u\leq N_p$), the total amount of parameters to be estimated is:
\begin{equation}
    N_{p,\text{total}} = N_u + N_c (N_p - N_u) = N_C N_p - (N_c - 1) N_u.
\end{equation}
It is clear, that we should avoid to needlessly assign every parameter individually since the volume
of the parameter space that needs to be sampled, scales exponentially with the dimension ie. the
number of parameters.
\textbf{[Das ist leider komplett unverständlich. Ich glaube, ich weiss schon, was du sagen möchtest, aber das muss umformuliert werden. Stichworte sind hier: Cell Variability, Heterogeneity, latent variables. Parameter per cell and individual parameters versteht auch niemand den Unterschied.]}

However, we will now present data that indicate that an individual treatment is in fact necessary.
Figure~\ref{fig:estimated-growth-rates} shows the rod-lengths of individual bacteria which have been
calculated from the extracted positions.
We fit a delayed exponential function to them which is defined by

\begin{equation}
    x(t) =
    \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
            x_0 \exp(\lambda (t-t_0)) & t\geq t_0\\
            x_0 & \text{ else}
    \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is the growth rate and $t_0$ the delay.
Fitting this function to the individual growth curves of the bacteria and their mean growth curve,
both results in good agreements (Figure~\ref{fig:estimated-growth-rates} A,B).
However, the latter exhibits large amounts of uncertainty within the data which is also illustrated
in subfigure (C).
There, we can see much more clearly the difference between considering individually assigned
parameters and global ones.
It is clear from this observation that in order for us to accurately estimate the parameters of this
system, we need to treat the bacteria individually.
\textbf{[Man ahnt was du meinst, doch leider ahnt man es nur. Vermeide Aussagen wie "it is clear".]}


% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item motivate individual treatment of cells
%     \item pro: get at distributions of parameters; even more than growth rates
%     \item pro: probably good idea to do this in this case, since more or less required (see figure)
%     \item con: computationally more demanding
%     \item can we improve the optimization algorithm to somehow "know" that some parameters are for
%         different cells and thus do not "interact" as other parameters with each other?
%         ie. they are part of the same subspace.

\subsection{Without Division}
In section we will focus on a time-interval which does not contain any division events and at which
the initial lag-phase of our bacteria has already passed.
\textbf{[Sprachlich wieder fragwürdig. "A time interval at which the initial lag-phase has passed" ist kein irgendwie korrekter englischer Satz.]}

By doing so, we can utilize the simpler and more performant direct comparison scheme for our cost function.
\textbf{[Hier weiss man nicht worüber du sprichst.]}

Furthermore, we need not to estimate the lag-time parameters which improves performance of our
optimization algorithm.
\textbf{[Verweise auf die entsprechende Gleichung.]}
\textbf{[Ich werde nun nicht mehr das Sprachliche kommentieren oder verbessern. Zuerst muss die gesamte Konzeption verbessert werden.]}

% For this dataset, we assumed that all parameters which specify the interaction potential are
% identical across all agents but growth rates of the cells are individual.
We chose to optimize for the damping of agents' movement within the medium, 3 interaction parameters
of the Mie potential $n,m,V_0$ a single radius $r$ for all agents and growth rates which were chosen
individually for each cell.
We removed any stochastic motion contributions by setting $D=0$.
This leads to a total of $5+1\times 6=11$ variable parameters.
As highlighted before, in order to model non-flexible rods, we set the rigidity and spring tension
of the rod to a high, fixed value.
To estimate these parameters we used the differential evolution~\cite{Storn1997} global optimization
algorithm which was initially seeded with a sample generated by the latin-hypercube~\cite{McKay1979}
method.
Finally, we performed a local minimization using the L-BFGS-B algorithm~\cite{Liu1989}.

Figure~\ref{fig:parameter-estimates-single-step} shows profile-likelihoods for each optimized
parameter with respect to the optimization results.
We can see that all parameters can be estimated by our optimization approach and that no
non-identifiability~\cite{Raue2009} is present.
These plots also show that the individual growth rates of the bacteria can be estimated effectively.

\subsection{With Division}

In the next step, we extend our previously used time-series with successive images including
cell division events which means that we now have to use the imaging-based comparison algorithm (see
section~\ref{section:parameter-estimation}).
A practical problem in extending the time series is that the segmentation algorithm was not able to
properly segment the individual bacteria around the division event which meant that we had to omit
parts of the snapshots, leaving us with only incomplete data.

% Since we have already optimized said system, we can reduce the computational demand by choosing the
% parameters which were obtained by our previous attempts and extend them with the parameters that the
% daughter cells will carry.
We optimize for the same parameters as done before.
In addition to assigning growth rates individually, we also need to consider division lengths at
which the bacteria split and the new individual growth rates of the daughter cells as additional
parameters.
Since our simulation involves the division of 4 cells into 8 new ones, in principle, this leads
to a total of $8$ new growth rates and $4$ division lengths.
% But to decrease the size of the parameter space, we assume that the growth rates of the daughter
% cells are identical between every sibling, leaving us at only $4$ new growth rates and a total of
% $8$ parameters.
% Future approaches should aim to loosen this assumption, allowing to optimize every new growth rate.
To optimize this system, we used a similar optimization approach by again seeding with samples
generated via latin-hypercube~\cite{McKay1979}, then applying the differential evolution
algorithm~\cite{Storn1997} and finally a local minimization with Nelder-Mead~\cite{Gao2010}.
We used the value $0.5$ for the parent penalty, which aims to provide a smooth transition between
not accounting for them and assigning full weighting to this difference.
Figure~\ref{fig:celldiffs-progression-with-division} shows the difference between the cell mask as
given by the data and the cell mask predicted by the best fit of our model.
As expected, the fully-optimized system does not produce differences where the parental penalty is
required.
However, its value is frequently used within the the optimization scheme itself.

We can again calculate likelihood profiles for every optimized parameter.
The results displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:likelihood-profiles-comparison-with-division} show that
some curves exhibit a plateau close to the calculated optimum of the estimated parameter.
This concerns the division lengths and some growth rates of the mother bacteria which both determine
if and when a cell divides.
Such behaviour can be attributed to the missing images around the division events of the cells which
were not able to be segmented.
\textbf{TODO check this with results}
It can be argued that this leads to a non-identifiability for the first division length while the
remaining parameters are still identifiable although the effect is also notable.
These results highlight a reassuring finding, namely that the method of profile-likelihood is able
to properly display this lack of data.
It therefore further underlines the accuracy and predictive power of our methods.

The imaging-based comparison algorithm is computationally much more expensive compared to the
simpler position-comparison algorithm.
There are 4 main steps which are executed within any single optimization iteration that contribute
to the total wall time.
These steps are prediction via the computational model ($15.63(21)\%$), mask adjustment of the data
masks ($14.49(19)\%$), mask rendering for the numerical results ($69.2(1.4)\%$) and finally
comparison of the masks ($0.68(5)\%$) (see section \ref{section:supplement-performance}).
The second step alters the masks provided by the data for every individual numerical simulation.
This is required since we need to ensure that the colors of the data-masks match the colors of the
masks produced by our computational model.
To this end, we need to construct a family tree of the data-bacteria and compare with the
\textit{in-silico} family tree.
We can see that the generation of masks from the numerical results takes up the majority of the work.
In addition, the step of mask adjustment would not have been required within the position-comparison
algorithm.
Combining these two values, the position-comparison algorithm is $\approx 6.13(8)$ times faster.

\section{Discussion}

With this work we have layed out a "blueprint" to estimate the parameters of \acp{abm} using
microscopic image time series.
\textbf{
    Es wird leider überhaupt nicht deutlich, was die Blaupause sein könnte.
    Wenn man das MS liesst, gewinnt man den Eindruck, du machst dies und das, aber ein einheitliches Konzept fehlt.
    Wir müssen zuerst eine Konzeption für das Paper entwickeln, bevor wir über weitere Details reden können.
}

Our approach is modularized such that its structure can be applied to a variety of problems.
We introduced a \ac{ib} computational model for rod-shaped bacteria that incorporates bendiness of
the rod and is implemented with \texttt{cellular\_raza} allowing it to be flexible in design and
readily applicable for computational studies.
Furthermore, we devised novel methods to extract the spatial positions and other information of
cell-agents from masks which have been segmented from microscopic images.
The extracting method was validated using results from our computational model.
We further implemented a pipeline that can produce 3D visualizations of simulation snapshots and can
generate cell masks from data as produced by our computational model.
These imaging techniques were also utilized to design a cost function that can compare snapshots
of cellular states across cellular division events, allowing us to estimate parameters across a
large time-span.
Finally, the combination of these preceding advancements were applied to 2 case studies, which showed
that the profile-likelihood method can be used to effectively evaluate the ability of our system to
properly identify the involved parameters.
In the first example, we fit a simplified model of a singular bent rod to microscopic images.
These results highlighted that a reduction of the systems parameters is necessary in order to
identify them.
In our next step, the same system was fitted to a series of microscopic images in two secarios,
excluding and incorporating division events.
Both results showed the ability of our model to effectively estimate individual parameters of the
cells.
The case including division events produced parameter profiles with minima that were not fully able
to estimate the chosen parameters.
These results ca be traced back to a gap within the provided segmentation masks.

Our work shows that it is possible to estimate the parameters of \acp{abm} on a single-cell level.
Together with the flexible nature of \texttt{cellular\_raza}, this opens up the possibility to
design minimal \acp{abm} which can be fit to data.
As such it formulates a blueprint for the parameter estimation of \acp{abm}.
The developed methods are publicly available as a well-documented python package
(\href{https://github.com/jonaspleyer/cr_mech_coli}{cr\_mech\_coli}).
The individual treatment of the cells allows us in principle to estimate the distribution of the
parameters directly without having to resort to any assumptions on the form of said distribution.
This is true for any parameter, not just the growth rates, since our approach can be generalized to
other individual cellular behaviours.

Future work should focus on multiple aspects that target challenges with respect to computational
efficiency and accuracy and extending the described model.
Additional biological effects include polar interactions~\cite{Duvernoy2018},
differentiation~\cite{vanGestel2015}, extracellular reactions~\cite{Li2025} (see also
table~\ref{table:simulation-aspects-supplement}).
When it comes to the designed algorithms, we have already discussed that the performance of
generating masks from computational results is the limiting factor for the performance of the
imaging-based comparison algorithm.
This problem could be targeted by rewriting existing code in C++ using native VTK~\cite{vtkBook}
instead of relying on the wrapper library pyvista~\cite{Sullivan2019}.
Another area of improvement is the position extraction algorithm which works well for cells living
in 2D or thin sheets but will not hold up when multiple bacteria are overlapping.
This task is well suited to be tackled by a purpose-built machine-learning tool that can either
reconstruct masks or accurately extrapolate positions from incomplete (possibly overlapping) masks.
Finally, the results of our computational model can be used to generate synthetic near-realistic
microscopic brightfield images together with their corresponding cell masks.
This combination of data allows us to train segmentation and more importantly tracking algorithms
which require large amounts of data.

In order to speed up the optimization process, it could also be valuable to initially consider all
parameters as global ones and once a certain threshold of tolerance is matched, losening this
restriction and treating cells individually.
This will allow the algorithm to initially search within a smaller space and possibly reach the
optimium more quickly in total.
Another factor that could be considered to improve performance is that individual parameters of
cells which are spatially separated will not have an immediate effect on each other, thus presenting
a loosely coupled or fully decoupled relationship.
Depening on the solver, this information could be exploited.
Ultimately, we desire to apply these methods to large amounts of data, which is done most
effectively by fitting our model to various image time-series simultanously which is yet to be
implemented.

Our approach furthermore highlighted that we are able to detect non-identifiabilities.
By choosing \texttt{cellular\_raza} as a modeling framework, we retain flexibility with respect to
model design thus effectively allowing us to reduce our model as we continue working on it.
\texttt{cellular\_raza} allows us to change the underlying representation if such unidentifiabilities
are determined to be structural (model-based) rather than practical (due to lack of
data).\textbf{TODO CITATION}
This allows us to iterate and find the model formulation which suits the data best but still retain
the mechanistic methodology of our approach.

As we continue to develop these methods, we expect to be able to reuse many of the existing
workflows\textbf{TODO better wording} such as likelihood estimation and uncertainty quantification
which have already been developed extensively for less complex systems such as \acp{ode}
\textbf{TODO CITATION}.

\section{Conclusion}

This work has introduced a novel methodological framework which allows us to estimate the parameters
of models describing rod-shaped bacteria on the single-cell level by using data obtained from
microscopic images.
The approach is agnostic with respect to details of the underlying model and instead only makes use
of the fundamental spatial representation of our bacteria as a collection of vertices.
In this way it highlights a modular blueprint that can be followed by researchers applied to models
of rod-shaped bacteria which incorporate other and more complex behaviours.
Combining these methods, our workflow links experimental data to the parameter estimation of a
mechanistic, computational model and allows us to estimate the individual parameters of the
cell-agents.

Our framework allow researchers to employ well-known methods such as profile-likelihood
\textbf{TODO CITATION} and sensitivity-analysis.
The code is publicly available as the python package
\href{https://github.com/jonaspleyer/cr_mech_coli}{cr\_mech\_coli}.
The utilized cellular properties are contained within the \texttt{cellular\_raza}~\cite{Pleyer2025}
package which provides flexibility in model design, thus enabling researchers to easily reuse,
extend and combine existing building blocks.
This allows researchers to extend the model and incorporate additional biological properties.

Future work will focus on the data-generation capabilities of the software.
We will aim to generate near-realistic microscopic brightfield images together with corresponding
segmentation masks in order to train segmentation and tracking algorithms.
On the biological side, a plethora of cellular properties waits to be investigated using this novel
tecnhique.
Another open question is how to efficiently scale up this operation in order to treat large amounts
of cells such that distributions of parameters themselves can be estimated.
Put together, this work establishes a promising platform which is able to directly combine
microscopic data with single-cell agent-based modeling techniques and offers a wide range of
opportunities for future quantitative studies in cellular biolgoy.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Highlight methodological advancements
%     \item Constructed Model which already combines many effects; possibility to extend this even further
%     \item can now use classical methods: sensitivity-analysis, likelihood estimators and uncertainty quantification
%     \item Proof of concept: Able to fit individual parameters of the agents; can be extend this?

%         "normalization" to ensure that the dimensions, pixels etc. are the same such that parameters
%         are comparable; also requires identical experimental setup

\subsection{Alternative Interaction Potential - Morse Potential}
The morse potential~\cite{Morse1929} is a common example of numerically inexpensive interaction
potential.
It was originally designed to describe the interaction of diatomic molecules but has since found use
in other areas~\cite{Breitwieser2021}.
It contains a repulsive and attractive part and is bound from above which makes it particularly
suitable for numerical simulations since unbound potentials can lead to large numerical deviations
thus compromising the prediction of the model.
The potential is of the form
\begin{equation}
    V(r) = V_0\left(1-e^{-\lambda(r-(R_1+R_2))}\right)^2
\end{equation}
and has 3 parameters.
The overall potential strength $V_0$, the radii of the particles $R_1,R_2$ and the potential
stiffness $\lambda$ which controls the rate of change as one travels along the radial axis.
We employ a spatial cutoff which sets the interaction strength to $0$ when exceeding a distance
$r\geq\xi$.

\subsection{Implementation \& Performance (TODO)}
\label{section:supplement-performance}

On the programming side, we are using the \texttt{pyo3} and \texttt{maturin} crates which allow us
to easily generate Python bindings and enable us to interoperate between the two ecosystems.

By using \texttt{cellular\_raza}, we can make use of multiple threads for running a single numerical
simulation, using the built-in parallelization methods (see Supplementary Material,
Figure~\ref{fig:performance}).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Quadratic Scaling comes from more dense simulation
    \item Overall number of agents which can be simulated is satisfactory for current purposes
    \item Improvement from $1 \Rightarrow 2$ and $2\Rightarrow4$ threads; first is major; second
        only minor
    \item Flamegraph still shows much cycles running against hurdles::Barrier::wait $\Rightarrow$
        this leaves room for improvement
    \item Flamegraph also shows that $\approx 75\%$ of all cycles is related to actual work (not
        just waiting).
        In particular to update\_mechanics functions.
